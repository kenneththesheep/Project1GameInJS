<br>I see you have interest in reading a portion of the game where most people will either skip or use it as a bedtime story. No matter whether you have accidentally stumble into this portion or are really geeky, we welcome you

---Storyline---
You are a daddy who is woken up in the middle of the night.
You hear your kid crying. 
You need to move in a dark room and find his milk bottle and a peg (you know how stinky a diapers can get). 
Once done, look for him, feed him, change his diaper and go back to bed.
